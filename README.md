# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Overview
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players take turns to place 'X' and 'O' on a 3x3 grid, and the first player to align three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

## Features
- Interactive 3x3 game board
- Player turns displayed with 'X' and 'O'
- Win detection for rows, columns, and diagonals
- Draw detection if the board is filled
- Reset button to start a new game

## How to Play
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Players take turns clicking on the empty cells to place their marks ('X' or 'O').
3. The game checks for a winner after each move.
   - If a player aligns three marks in a row, column, or diagonal, an alert will display the winner.
   - If all cells are filled and no one wins, an alert will display that the game is a draw.
4. Click the "Reset" button to clear the board and start a new game.

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the game.
- `styles.css`: Contains the CSS for styling the game board and other elements.
- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic for handling player moves, checking for winners, and resetting the game.
